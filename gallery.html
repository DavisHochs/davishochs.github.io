                <p class="gal-des">This is my very first webpage. It isn't much of a looker but it is a landmark. The journey
                    of becoming a web developer is much like becoming craftsman. Your first work may be clunky
                    and difficult to create and flat out not what you wish it could be. But it shows that
                    you took the first step to achieving something outside your current potential. To me, that
                    makes it look all the better.
